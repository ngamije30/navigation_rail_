# Flutter NavigationRail Demo

A simple Flutter app demonstrating the `NavigationRail` widget in a real-world Admin Dashboard scenario.

The NavigationRail widget is ideal for modern admin dashboards and tablet layouts.
It provides intuitive side navigation and is highly customizable.
Today, we explored three key properties:
selectedIndex (controls active section)
labelType (controls label visibility)
backgroundColor (customizes appearance)
With these, you can easily adapt NavigationRail to fit real-world app needs.

2. Clone this repository.
3. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```sh
